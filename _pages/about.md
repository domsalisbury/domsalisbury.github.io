<!--This is a comment-->
This site was set up to record some thoughts, to encourage me to write more, and to share whatever ended up here. It's also a way for me to mess about with Git, Github Pages, and Markdown.

I've now been ill for several years, and 'not quite right' for several years before that. I have a diagnosis of ME/CFS, which seems to fit my symptoms and illness trajectory better than any other possible diagnosis. I hope to post about ME/CFS, illness, healthcare, and related areas.

Prior to becoming to ill to maintain a job, I worked in scientific research in the fields of atmospheric and ocean physics. I obtained my PhD from the [University of Leeds](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-climate-atmospheric-science) in 2014, with a thesis investigating the role of ocean wave-breaking and whitecaps on air-sea exchange. I stayed in the same research group until the end of 2016, during which time my focus was investigation of air-sea exchange over Arctic sea ice.

I took a one-year position at [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) in September 2017, but by this stage my health was declining. I managed to stay in the role with a lot of support and by moving first to part-time hours and then to remote working.

I worked as a freelance copy-editor during 2019 and early 2020, editing manuscripts for publication in leading atmospheric science, ocean science, climate, and meteorology journals.
