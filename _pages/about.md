<!--This is a comment-->
I created this site to record some thoughts, to encourage me to write more, and to share whatever ended up here. It's also a way for me to mess about with Git, Github Pages, and Markdown.

I've now been ill with symptoms consistent with [myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html) since late 2016, though I wasn't fully well for several years before that. My diagnosis of ME/CFS seems to fit my symptoms and illness trajectory better than any other possible diagnosis.

Prior to becoming too ill to maintain a job, I worked in scientific research in the fields of atmospheric and ocean physics. I obtained my PhD from the [University of Leeds](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-climate-atmospheric-science) in 2014, with a thesis investigating the role of ocean wave-breaking and whitecaps on air-sea exchange. I stayed in the same research group until the end of 2016, during which time my focus was investigation of air-sea exchange over Arctic sea ice. I was lucky enough to spend six weeks onboard the Swedish icebreaker _Oden_ in summer 2014 as part of the [SWERUS-C3](http://www.swerus-c3.geo.su.se/) expedition.

I took a one-year position at [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) in September 2017, but by this stage my health was declining further. I managed to stay in the role with a lot of support and by moving first to part-time hours and then to remote working.

I worked as a freelance copy-editor during 2019 and early 2020, editing manuscripts for publication in leading atmospheric science, ocean science, climate, and meteorology journals.

<!--I hope to use this site to keep a [regular but infrequent journal](https://domsalisbury.github.io/categories/almanac/), and post about ME/CFS, illness, healthcare, and related issues.-->
