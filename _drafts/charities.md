The two largest ME/CFS charities in the UK are the [ME Association (MEA)](https://meassociation.org.uk/) and [Action For ME (AfME)](https://www.actionforme.org.uk/). Both provide information, support and advocacy for people with ME/CFS and their families and carers.

Both charities have been scrutinised and criticised by patients at various times over their histories. Most notably, AfME has been criticised for their initial involvement with and support of the PACE trial, and for their association with key biopsychosocial researchers, for example via MEGA (the ME/CFS Epidemiology and Genomics Alliance). Last year, the MEA came under fire from some patients for appointing Prof. Leslie Findley a Patron of the charity, due to his past support of psychosocial interventions. Professor Findley subsequently stepped down from this role (https://meassociation.org.uk/2021/10/professor-findley-withdraws-as-patron/). More recently, the MEA was the subject of a formal complaint from Valerie Eliot Smith, a barrister and person with ME who was treated unprofessionally and with disdain by a senior and longstanding official of the charity (https://valerieeliotsmith.com/2022/01/20/governance-under-scrutiny-identities-revealed-in-charity-complaint/).

The purpose of this post is to discuss some issues that I, and others before, have identified with both charities. This is constructive criticism. Both charities continue to do good work, and both are vital in the quest for a better future for ME/CFS patients in the UK (and beyond). I am not an expert in the third-sector, but I am frustrated ME patient who, like many patients, wants the best out of their charities.

# (1) Income and expenditure: Action For ME has considerable staffing costs and the MEA is sat on significant total funds
Both the MEA and AfME have a similar total income: the MEA reported a total income of £1,109,773 for the financial year ending 31 December 2020, whereas AfME reported a total income of £1,192,127 for the financial year ending 31 March 2021. Each charity brought in approximately £1 million in donations and legacies. Based on these figures, both charities just about squeeze in to the 'large' charity category, and they are in this respect comparable.

In the same financial year, the MEA had a total expenditure of £493,090 — approximately 44% of their total income — all of which went on 'charitable activities' (defined as the expenditure incurred by a charity in undertaking work to meet its charitable objectives). AfME had a total expenditure of £832,594, which is just under 70% of their total income; roughly 86% of this expenditure was on charitable activities, while the remaining 14% went on 'raising funds' (defined as the cost of raising the funds to finance a charity's objectives).

Almost three quarters (73%; £607,892) of AfME's total gross expenditure goes on staff salaries (which includes National Insurance and pension contributions), equivalent to 51% of the charities total income. The most recent information in the register of charities shows that AfME has 19 employees, 13 trustees, and 70 volunteers. However, AfME's website [currently lists 27 staff members (including the Chief Executive and the Director of Business Support & Development)](https://www.actionforme.org.uk/get-information/about-us/our-staff-team/), and states that, as of June 2021, the charity employs the full-time equivalent of 22.5 people. In contrast, the MEA has 8 employees, 6 trustees, and 24 volunteers according to its corresponding record with the register of charities. The MEA spent £192,228 on staffing costs in the 2020 financial year, three times less than AfME did in the 2020–2021 financial year.

The reasons for this disparity in staffing levels and costs are likely myriad: Action for ME is engaged in a wider range of activities — particularly with regards to provision of care and support services — than the MEA is, and, as illustrated above, the MEA relies more heavily on volunteers as opposed to paid employees.

<!--The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO) found that the median salary received by a CEO in the voluntary sector was £58,000 in 2021 (https://employeebenefits.co.uk/average-charity-ceo-salary-increases-3-6/).-->

While AfME spends much of its income on staffing costs, the MEA hasn't been spending. As of 31.12.20, the charity was sat on significant total funds (£2,336,939).

# (2) Both charities spend approximately 13% of income on directly funding (biomedical) research
What is clear from the above is that the fraction of income being used by each charity to fund biomedical research is likely smaller than many patients would imagine. In the 2020–2021 financial year, AfME spent £148,293 on funding biomedical research; that equates to 12.4% the charity's total income. The MEA in 2020 provided £150,337 of research funding, 13.5% of their total income.

I ran a small poll in the S4ME forum to see what percentage of charity income patients would expect to be allocated towards research funding.

Direct provision of funds — via the MEA's Ramsey Fund and AfME's — is not the only way the charity's can increase biomedical funding of ME. An alternative approach — and one that is now clearly necessary — is to lobby the government and/or funding bodies for increased provision. Indeed, AfME had a part to play in securing 2million in funding for the DecodeME project.

# (3) The ME Association needs a more modern approach to transparency and responsiveness

# (4) Both charities seem reluctant to prioritise the much-needed reboot of the CMRC
