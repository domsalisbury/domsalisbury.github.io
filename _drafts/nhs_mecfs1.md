Patients with a suspected diagnosis of ME/CFS are generally referred to their local service by their GP, although referral to a specialist service is not always possible or appropriate; in such cases, patients may fall under the care of hospital consultants, such as rheumatologists, or may remain under the care of their GP.

## Current setup
Basic information about the services can be found on the ME Association website (https://meassociation.org.uk/nhsspecialistservices/), though the transient nature of the services means the page is probably never quite up to date. A 2017 survey by the [British Association for CFS/ME (BACME)](https://www.bacme.info/) reported that around 50 services existed at that time. These services are commissioned by local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and should meet the need of the local population. The vast majority are delivered by an NHS organisation, while a small number are delivered by non-NHS organisations. Three services were solely pediatric, and nine services accepted adults and children or varying ages. Extrapolating from the incomplete survey statistics, the BACME report estimated that the services were seeing over 12,500 adults and 1000 children each year.

It is clear from the listings that there exists marked variation amongst the services. Many of the specialist services are run by a multidisciplinary team in an outpatient department of a trust hospital. In other locations, the service appears under the banner of a fatigue clinic, or even a persistent physical symptoms service; some of these are community based and can be accessed through self-referral.

On accessing a specialist service, patients may undergo further investigations if a diagnosis is not yet confirmed. The BACME report included statistics on diagnostic rates from the small number of services who could provide such data. A rough aggregation of the statistics reveals that around 50% of patients referred to the services obtain a diagnosis of ME/CFS and are taken on for therapy.

Patients diagnosed with ME/CFS will be offered a management programme and/or therapeutic interventions that are largely determined by the make-up and expertise of the team operating the service. The BACME report revealed considerable variation amongst the services with regards to their structure, management, and clinical leadership. Smaller services are generally staffed by a sole occupational therapist, and often there is no clinical input. The larger services are generally run by multi-disciplinary teams made up of different types of professionals and therapists (such as physiotherapists, psychologists, specialist nurses, and cognitive behavioural therapists), with clinical input from one or more consultants.

## Therapeutic interventions and the NICE guideline
What these services have in common is that the management programme should follow the recommendations made in the NICE clinical guideline for ME/CFS. The [current implementation of the guideline](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg53) recommends a personalised individual approach to management and the use of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and/or two differing approaches to activity/energy management known as graded exercise therapy (GET) and pacing. Nearly all services that responded to the BACME survey reported using aspects of GET and CBT in their therapy programme. Most services offer sessions that are integrated, and some offer sessions specific to a certain intervention. These core therapies are sometimes supplemented by additional interventions, such as counselling, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and mindfulness, as well as symptom control using medication.
