A FOI request to the [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)](https://www.nice.org.uk/) has revealed text-message lobbying of members of NICE's Guidance Executive, including the Chief Executive.

An embargoed copy of the final NICE guideline for ME/CFS — already severely delayed — was distributed to registered stakeholders on August 4 "for a final factual error check, to enable [stakeholders] to highlight to NICE any substantive errors, and to prepare for publication and implementation." The official publication of the guideline was scheduled for August 18.

However, on August 17, less than 12 hours before the scheduled publication time, NICE released a statement announcing that the guideline was being 'paused', owing to "issues raised during the pre-publication period with the final guideline." According to the statement, "unless the recommendations in the guideline are supported and implemented by professionals and the NHS, people with ME/CFS may not get the care and help they need." On August 27, NICE released a further statement announcing that it was to "hold a roundtable event to better understand the issues raised and determine how it can gain support for the guideline to ensure effective implementation."

Aware of the significant resistance to the draft guideline from certain quarters, and wanting to understand exactly what had transpired leading up to the decision by NICE to pause the guideline, on August 17 I [submitted a FOI request to NICE](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/nices_decision_to_pause_publicat#incoming-1905526).

>I am asking that NICE provides any and all
(i) internal correspondence/communication between NICE staff (including that involving the guideline committee or any individual member(s) of the committee); and
(ii) external correspondence/communication with professional bodies or individuals (guideline stakeholders or otherwise);

>that details or relates to the the decision to pause publication of the final guideline and any justification given for the pause. This should include - but is not limited to - evidence of the issues and concerns raised during the pre-publication period with the final guideline, and NICE's responses to these issues/concerns.

>Please include all correspondence pertaining to the above stated matters between 29 March 2021 and 17 August, 2021. My request is not limited to only the pre-publication period (4–18 August 2021) as the decision to pause may have been influenced by opposition to the guideline or other issues/concerns registered before the pre-publication period.

I received a delayed response to my request on October 29, shortly after the guideline was finally published. On November 1, I requested that NICE conduct an internal review of its decisions, and, with some decisions overturned, on November 15 I obtained an updated set of documents from NICE. This set of documents can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bw97vbdxy0p4acf/EH-317153_October21_NICEPause.zip?dl=0), along with a readme file and a copy of my internal review request and the response from NICE.

## Above board?
The files reveal that just two days after the release of the embargoed final guideline to stakeholders, an individual wrote to Paul Chrisp "to formally let [NICE] know that the Royal College of Psychiatrists will not be able to support the current version of [NICE's] guidance on Myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy)/chronic fatigue syndrome shared under embargo with us as registered stakeholder yesterday" as they "continue to have major concerns about this guidance" (Document 2).

On August 9, Paul Chrisp reached out to an individual at the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) to obtain their perspective on the guideline (Document 5). Based on information in this email conversation, this individual is likely to be Professor Lynne Turner-Stokes, author of a [December 2020 editorial in the BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4774) that criticised the draft guideline, in particular the approach to evidence evaluation. Responding on August 13, this individual asks Paul Chrisp if there is "actually any chance that anything we might say could still change things at this stage or is it simply a case of responding after publication?", before Paul Chrisp suggests the two have a phone call. It is not clear if this conversation took place, and, if so, how it proceeded.

## "There is a way."
Meanwhile, on August 9, the Chief Executive of NICE, Professor Gillian Leng, contacted Paul Chrisp via text (Text exchange 1) to request the two have a phone call. This seems to have been prompted by Gillian's conversation earlier that day with an individual whose name has been redacted. It seems that after the phone call between Gillian and Paul, Gillian forwarded a copied and pasted message she has received from a stakeholder. The message (split between pages 2 and 3 of Text exchange 1) is shown below. Note that this image has been created so that the message is shown as a whole, but none of the text has been changed.

This is clearly a highly-incriminating message that should never have been sent to Gillian.

One of the key reasons for my requesting an internal review was to find out the organisational identity of the individual who sent this message to Gillian, as this should not have been withheld. In response to my internal review, NICE confirmed that this individual "is associated with the Royal College of Psychiatrists."

Those unfamilar with the NICE process might have trouble understanding what individual is proposing (to none other than the Chief Executive of NICE). The individual is not particularly concerned with the guideline recommendations. Rather, the author of the message insists that NICE overrides and tampers with the Evidence Review — which forms the basis of the guideline recommendations — to reverse the decision to downgrade the quality of evidence from trails such as PACE.

High-placed individual
