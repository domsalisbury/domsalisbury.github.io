The BMJ (British Medical Journal) recently published a ['living' systematic review of interventions for long COVID (post-COVID condition)](https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-081318) by Zeraatkhar and coauthors.

I submitted a response to this paper — such letters to the editor are known at the BMJ as 'rapid responses' — to highlight some of the issues with the paper. My rapid response can be read [here](https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-081318/rr-1).

The paper contains myriad substantial errors and should never have been published. A more extended commentary on this paper and its shortcomings has been provided by [David Tuller](https://virology.ws/2024/12/03/trial-by-error-yet-again-bmj-recommends-cbt-and-exercise-for-long-covid/) and [Prof. Brian Hughes](https://thesciencebit.net/2024/11/28/that-bmj-review-of-long-covid-therapies-does-not-show-what-it-says-it-does/), while ME/CFS has written a [characteristially excellent critique](https://mecfsskeptic.com/the-bmj-review-on-long-covid-interventions/). The [rapid response by Chloé de Canson and coauthors](https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj-2024-081318/rr-2) is also worth reading.
