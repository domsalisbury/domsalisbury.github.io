As is customary when you sit a group of people in their twenties from the North West together, a conversation about Coronation Street will spark up. It happened to me recently. I sat back, quietly seething, for I had absolutely nothing to offer. This conversation was once my time to shine, but now I found myself joining the boring ranks of those whoâ€™d lost their nerve and turned their back on the soap, which celebrated its 10 000th episode this _month_.
