The [British Association for CFS/ME (BACME)](https://www.bacme.info/) describes itself as "a multidisciplinary organisation for UK professionals who are involved in the delivery of clinically effective services for patients with ME/CFS." Membership is open to clinicians and researchers, including psychologists, medical doctors, managers, students, and physiotherapists. BACME provides resources, education, and professional development to its members.


BACME has always been supportive of the 2007 guideline. Indeed, BACME members have been well represented on the NICE ME/CFS Guideline Committee

were on the guideline expert panel and/or were key figures in key research studies and clinical trials that formed part of the guideline evidence base.

"There is evolving evidence to indicate a dysregulation of multiple dynamic physiological systems in explaining the symptom picture seen in ME/CFS. Research has demonstrated changes in Immune System responses, Autonomic Nervous System function, Neuroendocrine pathways including the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis along with cellular metabolic changes."

## 'Not deconditioning, but dysregulation'
The BACME Position Paper—along with the content of the two presentations—points to a new illness model and therapy approach, which could be described as ‘Dysregulation not deconditioning’. I suspect the majority of patients would agree that there does seem to be dysregulation of many bodily systems in ME/CFS. However, BACME seem to be extrapolating from this clinical evidence of dysregulation to making it the basis of a new illness model of ME/CFS. This is despite the recent history of the deconditioning model falling to pieces when subject to any real scrutiny (see the recent NICE draft guideline for ME/CFS).

Why is there a need to treat ME/CFS so differently from comparable illnesses? The narrative in the new model is that with self-management and certain interventions patients can re-regulate their bodies on a path to rehabilitation (if not full recovery).

If a therapy approach is to be rolled out in clinics, it should first be evidenced. So where is the evidence that such interventions work? No evidence was presented in Dr Gladwell’s talk. What even are the interventions, because the presentations were characteristicly scant on actual practical details.

What exactly are the ‘'dysregulation principles' mentioned in the paragraph given above from the BACME Position Paper?

It would seem that the evidence underpinning a re-regulation model of rehabilitation in ME/CFS patients is extremely thin. This leads me to several questions:
1. Why should it be assumed that patients have the power to re-regulate their bodily systems—systems that may have gone haywire overnight, or may have been haywire for many years? We have no idea of the primary cause(s) of this dysregulation occurs, so why should it be expected that patients can reverse it? 
2. Is there any evidence that re-regulation can be achieved in ME/CFS patients through such therapy? It would seem the BACME approach is to be guided self-management with behavioural changes (such as regulating sleep time and duration, for example). Interestingly, the word dysregulation does not appear in draft NICE guideline, except in a couple of evidence reviews that included one study looking at 'emotional dysregulation', which is of course different but uses the same terminology. 
3. Is this model applied to any other illnesses? Related to (2), 'dysregulation' often appears in the context of psychiatric illness and mood disorder. BACME has been clear that they are talking about dysregulation of bodily systems such as the immune system and HPA axis, but this could be a troublesome association. 
4. Above all, do we even need a model for illness and rehabilitation at this time, given we know so little about the etiology of ME/CFS, and given the heterogeneity in patients’ symptoms and illness course? What would happen if the clinics didn't adopt a theoretical model and just focused on symptom management and support (where needed)? 
In summary, I feel this is a deeply-flawed and brazen move by BACME that will not pay dividends in the long run. The webinar was called ‘Understanding Dysregulation in ME/CFS’. We don’t understand it! At all! It is great that BACME are acknowledging it. Clinicians having a good grasp of dysregulation in ME/CFS is a step forward; it could help explain certain symptoms to patients and even signpost them to other related diagnoses and their treatments (e.g, dysautonomia and PoTs). However, concocting a new illness model and therapy approach without clinical evidence—and without any understanding of what’s causing this dysregulation—is not the way forward. This is all set up to be the Deconditioning Model Part 2.
