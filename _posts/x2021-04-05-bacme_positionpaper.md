The [British Association for CFS/ME (BACME)](https://www.bacme.info/) describes itself as "a multidisciplinary organisation for UK professionals who are involved in the delivery of clinically effective services for patients with ME/CFS." Membership is open to clinicians and researchers, including psychologists, medical doctors, managers, students, and physiotherapists. BACME provides resources, education, and professional development to its members, who primarily work within the network of locally-commissioned specialist ME/CFS clinics scattered around the country. As such, BACME has influence over how these clinics are run. BACME also has influence on the NICE Guideline, with members on the Guideline Committee, and BACME members have been part of key research studies and clinical trials that form(ed) part of the guideline evidence base.

In October 2020, and in anticipation of the release of the updated NICE Guideline for ME/CFS in 2021, BACME released a [Position Paper](https://www.bacme.info/sites/bacme.info/files/BACME%20Position%20Paper%20on%20the%20Management%20of%20ME-CFS%20October%202020.pdf) on the management of ME/CFS. The statement includes a refutation of the [deconditioning model of ME/CFS](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Deconditioning), one of the founding pillars of the biopsychosocial (BPS) approach to understanding the illness, and the primary justification for interventions such as graded exercise therapy (GET) and cogntive behavioural therapy (CBT). Despite this, BACME reaffirmed their commitment to CBT and a slightly less bombastic form of GET which they call 'graded activity strategies'. The ME Association published a succinct and measured [repsonse](https://meassociation.org.uk/2020/10/me-association-response-to-bacme-position-statement-on-the-management-of-me-cfs/) to the paper, setting out their concerns.

## Deconditioning out, dysregulation in
The BACME statement was timed to coincide and align with the release of the **draft** NICE Guideline for ME/CFS in November 2020. However, the expected publication date for the final guideline was recently pushed back from 21 April 2021 to 18 August 2021. The (draft guideline)[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ng10091/documents/] advises that patients should not be offered 'any programme based on fixed incremental physical activity or exercise, for example graded exercise therapy or structured activity or exercise programmes that are based on deconditioning as the cause of ME/CFS.' In addition, the use of CBT as a therapeutic intervention is downgraded to a supportive rather than curative role. Instead, the draft guideline recommends activity and energy management. This intervention does not assume that deconditioning is the cause of ME/CFS.

The BACME paper states:
>'BACME does not support the deconditioning model of ME/CFS as a primary cause for the condition. It is recognised that deconditioning may be, for some, an additional complicating factor of living with any disabling chronic health condition.'

Of course, BACME has historically supported the deconditioning model for ME/CFS.
Predicament for BACME, but some clinics had already dropped basic tenets of the BPS approach and moved towards interventions that have general support amongst patients, namely some form of pacing or lifestyle management. The BACME paper points to a new emphasis on 'dysregulation':
>'There is evolving evidence to indicate a dysregulation of multiple dynamic physiological systems in explaining the symptom picture seen in ME/CFS. Research has demonstrated changes in Immune System responses, Autonomic Nervous System function, Neuroendocrine pathways including the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis along with cellular metabolic changes.'

In this context, dysregulation is used to refer to the myriad abnormalities and impairments that have been reported in ME/CFS patients. So far, such findings are disparate, in that together they haven't yet led to identification of a particular pathology. The BACME statement points to their recognition of these findings, which are often seen by patients and biomedical researchers as evidence for the biological/organic nature of the illness.

Clinician training...positive step.

## A dysregulation 'model' of ME/CFS
The Position Paper makes it clear that dysregulation is to form a core part of BACME's understanding of managing ME/CFS, although it isn't at all clear how:
>'BACME supports clinicians to underpin rehabilitative and therapeutic processes with a grounding in dysregulation principles.'

BACME seems to be extrapolating from clinical evidence of dysregulation to making it the basis of a new illness model of ME/CFS.

>'The increased fatigue that people with CFS experience usually leads them to take prolonged rest. This prolonged rest has physical consequences. Medical investigations show that there is no disease cause for these physical symptoms, they occur as a direct result of inactivity and prolonged rest.'

>'The increased fatigue that people with ME/CFS experience usually leads them to take prolonged rest. This prolonged rest has physical consequences. Medical investigations show that there is no disease cause for these physical symptoms. They are related to the dysregulation of several body systems in particular the autonomic nervous system, HPA axis and the immune system. Coping strategies such as prolonged rest and inactivity can inadvertently maintain the symptoms.'

Inserting an intermediate step (i.e., the 'dysregulation') between thoughts and behaviours, and symptoms.

## Criticisms of the new approach

Why is there a need to treat ME/CFS so differently from comparable illnesses? The narrative in the new model is that with self-management and certain interventions patients can re-regulate their bodies on a path to rehabilitation (if not full recovery).

If a therapy approach is to be rolled out in clinics, it should first be evidenced. So where is the evidence that such interventions work? At this stage it is not at all clear what the interventions may be.

What exactly are the ‘dysregulation principles' mentioned in the paragraph given above from the BACME Position Paper?

A key point to the model is that the dysregulation is seen as reversible. This allows the narrative (myth) of expected recovery/rehabilitation to continue.


It would seem that the evidence underpinning a re-regulation model of rehabilitation in ME/CFS patients is extremely thin. This leads me to several questions:
1. Why should it be assumed that patients have the power to re-regulate their bodily systems—systems that may have gone haywire overnight, or may have been haywire for many years? We have no idea of the primary cause(s) of this dysregulation occurs, so why should it be expected that patients can reverse it? 
2. Is there any evidence that re-regulation can be achieved in ME/CFS patients through such therapy? It would seem the BACME approach is to be guided self-management with behavioural changes (such as regulating sleep time and duration, for example). Interestingly, the word dysregulation does not appear in draft NICE guideline, except in a couple of evidence reviews that included one study looking at 'emotional dysregulation', which is of course different but uses the same terminology. 
3. Is this model applied to any other illnesses? Related to (2), 'dysregulation' often appears in the context of psychiatric illness and mood disorder. BACME has been clear that they are talking about dysregulation of bodily systems such as the immune system and HPA axis, but this could be a troublesome association. 
4. Above all, do we even need a model for illness and rehabilitation at this time, given we know so little about the etiology of ME/CFS, and given the heterogeneity in patients’ symptoms and illness course? What would happen if the clinics didn't adopt a theoretical model and just focused on symptom management and support (where needed)? 
In summary, I feel this is a deeply-flawed and brazen move by BACME that will not pay dividends in the long run. The webinar was called ‘Understanding Dysregulation in ME/CFS’. We don’t understand it! At all! It is great that BACME are acknowledging it. Clinicians having a good grasp of dysregulation in ME/CFS is a step forward; it could help explain certain symptoms to patients and even signpost them to other related diagnoses and their treatments (e.g, dysautonomia and PoTs). However, concocting a new illness model and therapy approach without clinical evidence—and without any understanding of what’s causing this dysregulation—is not the way forward. This is all set up to be the Deconditioning Model Part 2.
