The BMJ (British Medical Journal) recently commissioned and published a highly dubious [opinion piece](https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r977) by [Alastair Miller](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Miller) and coauthors arguing that patients with severe ME/CFS need hope and that they can recover with what they call 'specialist rehabilitation'.

I submitted a [rapid response](https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r977/rr-6) to the journal, focusing on one particular issue â€” namely the authors' ignorance about post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS and their conflation of the illness with other 'chronic fatigue conditions'. A host of other rapid responses have rightly torn the opinion piece to shreds.
