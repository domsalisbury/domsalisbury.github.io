January was a quite unremarkable month. Healthwise, late Autumn was the last time I had a 'better' period. The monotony of chronic illness and lockdown has started to get to me. I have been simultanously bored and unable to do that much - either physically or cognitively. This is nothing new for me, but the sheer misery of the January weather along with the current circumstances has got to me. My tinnitus has been worse than 'baseline', particularly as I'm now having issues with my right ear (most likely connected to ongoing jaw issues / nocturnal bruxism).
