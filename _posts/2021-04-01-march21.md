What can I say about March? other than it came and went and I spent most of March feeling really quite unwell. Is this a prolonged crash, or a new normal?

I've tried this month to disengage (slightly) from politics. It was all becoming a little too much. The cynicism that pervades the Left in the UK at the moment (especially on Twitter) is totally justified, but it's such a drain. It can make the situation feel utterly helpless. Let's see how long this lasts....

I got to see my sister, nephew and niece at the end of the month. Here is Millie looking very content:
