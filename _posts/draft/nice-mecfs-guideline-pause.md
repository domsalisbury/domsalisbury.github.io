A FOI request to the [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)](https://www.nice.org.uk/) has revealed

>I am asking that NICE provides any and all
(i) internal correspondence/communication between NICE staff (including that involving the guideline committee or any individual member(s) of the committee); and
(ii) external correspondence/communication with professional bodies or individuals (guideline stakeholders or otherwise);

>that details or relates to the the decision to pause publication of the final guideline and any justification given for the pause. This should include - but is not limited to - evidence of the issues and concerns raised during the pre-publication period with the final guideline, and NICE's responses to these issues/concerns.

>Please include all correspondence pertaining to the above stated matters between 29 March 2021 and 17 August, 2021. My request is not limited to only the pre-publication period (4â€“18 August 2021) as the decision to pause may have been influenced by opposition to the guideline or other issues/concerns registered before the pre-publication period.

There were several other FOI requests to NICE on this matter made through the WhatDoTheyKnow website; these can be found by searching the requests on [this page](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/nice).

I received a response to my request on September.... All the information supplied to me has been uploaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bw97vbdxy0p4acf/EH-317153_October21_NICEPause.zip?dl=0).
